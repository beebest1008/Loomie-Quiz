      <h2>You are...</h2>

      <h3>Judicio Loomie</h3>
      <p>You’re the wise one of the flock — curious, calm, and always learning! You’re the kind of owlet who brings a “Young Scientist” book for fun, packs your bag the night before, and reminds your friends to switch off the fan in class. You love facts, lists, and keeping things in order — even during a fire drill! Whether it’s chess, Math Olympiad, or upcycling plans, you help the team think clearly and stay prepared.</p>

      <h3>Conquero Loomie</h3>
      <p>You’re always ready to take action — dependable, bold, and full of heart! You help Ah Ma in the kitchen, carry books for your teacher, and guide your classmates to safety like a mini leader. You’re in Uniform Groups or the Green Club, organising missions to collect old uniforms and check in on everyone. You believe that small acts — like leading a VIA project or helping at a shelter — can make a big difference.</p>

      <h3>Socio Loomie</h3>
      <p>You’re the heart of the group — cheerful, loyal, and always looking out for your friends! You’re first to finish your homework so you can play catch or five stones at the playground, and you never makan alone. You cheer people up during fire drills and make sure no one feels left behind. You shine in the choir, student council, or Peer Support Group — where your kindness and teamwork lift everyone higher.</p>

      <h3>Origino Loomie</h3>
      <p>You’re full of wonder — expressive, artsy, and bursting with ideas! You spend your free time making slime, folding lucky stars, and turning rainbow loom bands into bracelets. You shine in the Art Club or Speech & Drama, and when problems arise, you're sewing custom masks or designing plushies from old uniforms. Your vision turns scraps into magic — and inspires others to dream too.</p>
